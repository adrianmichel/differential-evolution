  <body>The zip file containing the library and additional projects and documentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.amichel.com/de/de.zip">http://www.amichel.com/de/de.zip</a>.<br/><br/>Although this package contains Visual Studio project files, the entire code was written to be 100% portable and should build and run on any platform on which boost.org based C++ code can be built.<br/><br/>Here are the zip file directories and their content:<br/><br/><ul>
      <li>
        <strong>.\</strong> - the Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 solution files for the sample application. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>.\differentialevolution</strong> - the differential evolution library .hpp files. This is a header only library and does not generate linkable libraries, although it depends on several boost libraries that themselves require linking. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>.\de_test</strong> - source code for a functional, portable command line sample and test application project. Examine the source files and run the binaries (found under the bin directory) from the command line for more information on the supported functionality and command line arguments. This project also contains the tutorial code. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>.\bin</strong> - prebuilt debug and release Windows binaries that can be run immediately. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>.\boost</strong> - all boost source files and binaries required to build the sample application de_test using either VS2008 or VS2010. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>.\doc</strong> - documentation in html format. </li>
    </ul><br/><br/></body>
